         <h5>A Little about myself</h5>
         <p> I grew up in the capital of washington, I love to travel and have been to about 25 states and 2 countries. I love being outdoors and also relaxing in with the family. Software development has always been an interest of mine, I studied web design for two years in high school and went to the Art institute of seattle for web design as well as Colorado Technical University for Computer science.</p>
         I am striving to work with a team to build a full stack
          application. I am finishing up a full stack MERN software development course with SkillSpire, I Graduate at the end of August. I have several Works showcased in my portfolio page on this app go check them out to see if my skill set is what you are looking for. I look forward from hearing from you soon and working with your team.
